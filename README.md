# Write a Data Science Blog Post

For this project, I worked with public datasets from AirBnB, and answered 3 business questions:

1. Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?
2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
3. Understand if there is anything about the properties that helps you predict price.

Installations: In this project Python 3.x and the following Python libraries were installed:

- Pandas https://pandas.pydata.org/
- Numpy https://numpy.org/
- Matplotlib.pyplot https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html
- OS https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
- Sklearn https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

Data:
1. Listings, including full descriptions and average review score - listings.csv
2. Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments - reviews.csv
3. Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day - calendar.csv

There are 6 parts in this project:
- Prepare listings data
- Prepare calendar data
- Prepare reviews data
- Putting it all together
- Question 1. Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?
- Question 2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
- Question 3. Understand if there is anything about the properties that helps you predict price.
